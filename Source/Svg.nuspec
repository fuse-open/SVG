    <description>Custom .NET 4.5 build of SVG library located at https://github.com/vvvv/SVG for Fuse, which is
a fork of the C# SVG rendering library on codeplex: https://svg.codeplex.com/.

This package was created due to some issues with running the .NET 3.5 vvvv nuget package on mono.

From the official package description:

This started out as a minor modification to enable the writing of proper SVG strings. But now after almost two years we have so many fixes and improvements that we decided to share our current codebase to the public in order to improve it even further.

So please feel free to fork it and open pull requests for any fix, improvement or feature you add.</description>
